\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

% The numerical stability of the computational analyses plays an important role in the repro-
% ducibility of the scientific findings. It has been evaluated that results are sensitive to the
% computing environment changes such as operating system and analysis toolbox, particularly
% in computationally intensive domains where results rely on a series of complex computations.
% The successful completion of this thesis will result in the tools that enable software develop-
% ers and researchers to evaluate the stability of their pipelines and results when dynamically
% linked mathematical libraries are changed. Furthermore, the findings of this project can be
% used to narrow down further investigations toward stabilizing pipelines.
% We proposed three contributions through this thesis. The first contribution is imple-
% menting the Spot tool, which has been published in the GigaScience journal. Second, we
% completed the MCA-based interposition technique that simulates OS variability, presented
% in Chapter 2, and has been submitted in the MICCAI conference. The third contribution
% of this thesis is comparing tool variability and numerical variability using the MCA-based
% method, described in Chapter 3, which is anticipated to be completed by the end of Sum-
% mer 2021 and published as a journal paper.
