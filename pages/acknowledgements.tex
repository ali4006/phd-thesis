\begin{acknowledgments}

  First and foremost, I would like to thank my research supervisor Tristan Glatard for all the invaluable support, understanding,
  guidance, and encouragement he has given me over the past years.
  Without his assistance and dedicated involvement in every step throughout the process, the success of this thesis would not be possible.
  I would also like to thank my research team members, Gregory Kiar and Yohan Chatelain, for their generous advice and ongoing contributions to my work.
  Special thanks to all the /bin lab members for a cherished time spent together in the lab and social settings,
  with a special mention to Valerie and Martin; you guys have been wonderful labmates.
  Getting through my dissertation required more than academic support, and I have many people to thank for listening to and, at times, 
  having to tolerate me over the past years. 
  My appreciation also goes out to my family and friends for their unconditional love, encouragement, and support throughout my studies.
  % I am also grateful to Concordia University for trusting me and the infrastructure
  % and financial support you provided for completing this thesis work.
